## What is Docker? ![alt text](image.jpg)
Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications in a containerized environment. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that contain all the necessary dependencies and configuration files to run an application.

Docker allows developers to package an application and its dependencies into a single container, which can then be deployed on any platform that supports Docker. This makes it easier to move applications between different environments, from development to testing to production, without the need for manual configuration or installation of dependencies.

Docker also provides a centralized repository called Docker Hub, where developers can share and download pre-built Docker images for popular applications and frameworks. This helps to reduce the time and effort required to set up a development environment, as developers can simply download the necessary Docker images and start building their application immediately.
